# Beacon

## Mission Statement

Stop wasting time. Make a connection.

## Problem

As students, we are often faced with empty time between classes. The process of coordinating, planning, and communicating with friends to fill these empty time slots is an organizationally annoying process for students. This process usually involves a myriad of online communication efforts like social media, instant messages, or even location sharing platforms.

## Solution

Our solution is to create a cross-mobile application that allows for on-demand location sharing to help students find friends and make better use of gaps in their schedules. 

The application will have a default “off-state” meaning users will turn on their location sharing only when they want to be found. 

Our project aims to implement a new type of on-demand location sharing to help connect students and find friends to make better use of gaps in their schedules.

## Priorities

1. **Correctness** - Our application should be functional and achieve the requirements placed by the team and spec.
2. **Usefulness** - A user will only use Beacon if it is useful in their social lives.
3. **Usability** - The features should be usable in all aspects of the user’s experience.
4. **User efficiency** - Should be quick and simple when using app.
5. **Portability** - Our application should work on both Android and iOS.
6. **Privacy** - Our application is accessing user locations and should be stored securely.
7. **Security** - Our application contains user data and profiles and should be secure when managing user data.
8. **Learnability** - Our application should easily be able to set up a beacon and find other beacons.
9. **Consistency** - App will follow a design language and common design conventions
10. **Reliability** - The app and backend system should be up and usable, and not crash.
11. **Accessibility** - Any user should be able to perform the app’s functions.
12. **Robustness** - The app should not crash from unexpected errors. If the system cannot do a task, it should present the user with an error.
13. **Verifiability** - Our application will contain functional components that should be verifiable in accomplishing their functions accurately and repeatedly.
14. **Performance** - We just want our application to work.
15. **Interoperability** - The app will only work on Android and iOS devices
16. **Reusability** - Our goal is to build an app with a specific purpose, but users should be able to use it how they wish.
17. **Maintainability** - We don’t plan on revisiting this application.
