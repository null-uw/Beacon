## Download Instructions

PRE: Our team has prioritized the deployment of our application for Android. iOS deployment to devices instructions are listed below, but do require a significant amount of additional effort and dependencies. 

### Android

#### Requirements

1. Android Device

#### Instructions

1. To start, you will need to allow the installation of APK's on your Android device's browser. To do so, follow the instructions found here: 
[enable APK Downloads](https://www.expressvpn.com/support/vpn-setup/enable-apk-installs-android/)
2. On your Android device, find our latest release found on our Github repository: [Beacon Releases](https://github.com/null-uw/Beacon/releases)
3. Under the latest release, click 'Assets' to reveal the assets associated with the release.
4. Click on 'app-release.apk' to download our APK.
5. Our APK should download to your device and be ready for use. On the application's first launch, you may need to accept a notification confirming you'd like to open an application downloaded from the internet.
