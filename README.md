## Mission Statement

Stop wasting time. Make a connection.

## Problem

As students, we are often faced with empty time between classes. The process of coordinating, planning, and communicating with friends to fill these empty time slots is an organizationally annoying process for students. This process usually involves a myriad of online communication efforts like social media, instant messages, or even location sharing platforms. 

Our project aims to implement a new type of on-demand location sharing to help connect students and find friends to make better use of gaps in their schedules.

## Priorities

1. **Correctness** - Our application should be functional and achieve the requirements placed by the team and spec.

3. **Usability** - The features should be usable in all aspects of the user’s experience.
4. **User efficiency** - Should be quick and simple when using app.
5. **Portability** - Our application should work on both Android and iOS.
6. **Privacy** - Our application is accessing user locations and should be stored securely.
7. **Security** - Our application contains user data and profiles and should be secure when managing user data.
8. **Learnability** - Our application should easily be able to set up a beacon and find other beacons.
9. **Consistency** - App will follow a design language and common design conventions
10. **Reliability** - The app and backend system should be up and usable, and not crash.
11. **Accessibility** - Any user should be able to perform the app’s functions.
